# OLA-ensemble
## Introduction
### From the company’s perspective:
- Ola is a leading ride-sharing platform, aiming to provide reliable, affordable, and
convenient urban transportation for everyone.
- The constant challenge Ola faces is the churn rate of its drivers. Ensuring driver
loyalty and reducing attrition are crucial to the company's operation.
- Analyzing driver data can reveal patterns in driver behavior, performance, and
satisfaction. This would help in foreseeing potential churn, allowing proactive
measures.
- By leveraging data science and ensemble learning, Ola can predict driver churn,
which would be pivotal in its driver retention strategy.

### From the learner’s perspective:
- Engaging with this case offers a practical understanding of how ride-sharing
giants operate and the challenges they face.
- Ensemble learning, comprising various algorithms and techniques, can
significantly improve prediction accuracy over standalone methods.
- This exercise hones the participant's skills in imputation, dealing with class
imbalances, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Additionally, learners gain hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems,
transforming raw data into actionable insights that can guide business strategies.

## Problem Statement

Assuming as a data scientist at Ola, you are entrusted with the responsibility of analyzing the dataset to predict driver attrition. Your primary goal is to utilize ensemble learning techniques, evaluate the performance of your models, and provide actionable insights to reduce driver churn.
- Additional Views
    - This is the classification problem for churning, we need to track the various metrics like Recall, ROC-AUC curve etc.
    - As this industry is very competitive we need to focus more on the trained feature importances.
